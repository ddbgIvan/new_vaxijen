Scripts for data mining
The script split_dataset.py splits data from a FASTA file with protein sequences into test and training sets in a ratio 1:5.
The script fasta2ACC_Edescriptors.py transform each sequence in a fasta file in a numerical vector of E descriptor and apply an auto- and cross- covariance transformation to that vector.
